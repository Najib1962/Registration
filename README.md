# Complete user registration system using PHP and MySQL database

In this tutorial, I walk you through the complete process of creating a user registration system where users can create an account by providing username, email and password, login and logout using PHP and MySQL. I will also show you how you can make some pages accessible only to logged in users. Any other user not logged in will not be able to access the page.
